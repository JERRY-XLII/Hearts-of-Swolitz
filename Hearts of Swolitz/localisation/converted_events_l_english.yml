 conv.political.1.t:10 "Absolutism on the Rise"
 conv.political.10.c:10 "At the end, a state must respect the will of its people. [Root.GetName] will hold the referendum"
 conv.political.10.d:10 "[Root.GetLeader] is only seen as a usurper by these evergrowing movements in [Root.GetName]. Soon, [Root.GetAdjective] people will revolt against the government, asking for a strong leader chosen by God Almighty. They are now demanding by us to make all humans who believe in the only God to choose whether they want the monarchy or the current regime."
 conv.political.10.t:10 "[Root.GetAdjective] Reactionaries demanding referendum"
 conv.political.11.c:10 "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 conv.political.11.d:10 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 conv.political.11.t:10 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.12.c:10 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 conv.political.12.d:10 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 conv.political.12.t:10 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.13.a:10 "Time to show these mediæval protesters how modern war is done."
 conv.political.13.b:10 "In the name of God Almighty, may He choose who to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.13.d:10 "Oh, [Root.GetLeader], the people thought you were not chosen by God and they tried to persuade you to do a referendum. But having you denied them, they preferred to do the will of God Almighty by themselves."
 conv.political.13.t:10 "For God to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.14.a:10 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 conv.political.14.b:10 "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 conv.political.14.d:10 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 conv.political.14.t:10 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 conv.political.15.a:10 "We will stop them at any cost!"
 conv.political.15.b:10 "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.15.d:10 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 conv.political.15.t:10 "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 conv.political.16.a:10 "Pathetic, that's the right word."
 conv.political.16.d:10 "The self-styled King of [Root.GetName] is now dead and his followers forgot how to fight. The people learnt the lesson, our regime is protected by God more than those pathetic old men yelling at clouds."
 conv.political.16.t:10 "Fanatic Reactionaries defeated"
 conv.political.17.a:10 "What a bunch of quitters."
 conv.political.17.d:10 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 conv.political.17.t:10 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 conv.political.18.a:10 "What a bunch of clowns."
 conv.political.18.d:10 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 conv.political.18.t:10 "Fascists Ridiculed"
 conv.political.19.a:10 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.19.t:10 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 conv.political.19_absolutist:10 "The path of monarchy is safer. Absolutism will it be."
 conv.political.19_fascism:10 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. We are no longer safe on our own. We must stand with our fascist partners against our enemies. If we do not choose a side, we will perish alone.'"
 conv.political.2.a:10 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 conv.political.2.b:10 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 conv.political.2.d:10 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 conv.political.2.t:10 "Move Towards Democracy"
 conv.political.3.a:10 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 conv.political.3.b:10 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 conv.political.3.d:10 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 conv.political.3.t:10 "Fascism on the Rise"
 conv.political.4.a:10 "Our only hope is that they won't organize a coup against us"
 conv.political.4.d:10 "Some may say these are just old man yelling at clouds, but the Reactionary movement is costantly gaining new supporters. What should the government do about this, however, is difficult to tell."
 conv.political.4.t:10 "Reactionary Ideas spreading throughout [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.5.a:10 "*Sigh*, maybe we could give them that figure to avoid the destruction of [Root.GetName]?"
 conv.political.5.d:10 "Our glorious regime is being menaced by our own soldiers. They claim for a strong figure of power, chosen by God Almighty. It will only be a matter of time before they'll embrace arms publicely against [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.5.t:10 "Absolutist Soldiers won't pledge allegiance to [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.6.a:10 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 conv.political.6.d:10 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 conv.political.6.t:10 "The Threat of Communism"
 conv.political.7.a:10 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 conv.political.7.d:10 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 conv.political.7.t:10 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 conv.political.8.a:10 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 conv.political.8.d:10 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 conv.political.8.t:10 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 conv.political.9.a:10 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 conv.political.9.b:10 "Let the people be heard."
 conv.political.9.d:10 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 war_justification.27.d:10 "'In modern history, perhaps even in history as a whole, there has been no worse tyranny than the iron grip in which [From.GetRulingParty] now holds [From.GetName]. People may argue that we should not provoke conflict, that we should trust [From.GetLeader] to honor treaties and promises in the future, but these people fail to see that treaties made under the reign of fascism are useless. To these dishonorable liars, might makes right, and the paper on which an agreement is written burns just as easily as the books of their detractors.'\n\nPeople who have long hoped to avoid a direct confrontation with [From.GetName] have now been strongly opposed by [Root.GetLeader], who argues that we in Machiavellian terms are merely postponing war to the advantage of the enemy. At this rate, we may strike the first blow after all."

 war_justification.28.d:10 "'Despite our attempts to find a diplomatic solution to our conflict with [From.GetName], negotiations have once again broken down, leaving us with limited options. The authoritarian [From.GetLeader] regime has displayed the unreasonable approach to this matter typical of leaders who are not accountable to their people. Barring a complete turnaround in the policies of [From.GetAdjective] leadership, we will be left with no recourse but to fight.'\n\n[Root.GetAdjective] intervention in [From.GetName] has been a hot issue, with some politicians in the opposition claiming that [Root.GetRulingParty] has pursued a hawkish policy from the start. Whatever their original intent, a future war now suddenly seems very real and inevitable."

However, another country claims to be a better nation than us and that is, the one that is ruled by the inferior [From.GetLeader] with his [From.GetRulingParty]. There can be only one Rike, ours, the one that is obviously superior!'\n\nInspiring as always, [Root.GetLeader] recently stated how [From.GetName] is a rival Rike that needs to be annihilated by our mighty soldiers."

 war_justification.30.d:10 "'The [From.GetAdjective] claim to have liberty and democracy, claim to want peace, but all of these things they pride themselves on are hollow. Their democracy divides the people where it should stand united and their liberty only betrays a lack of discipline. We [Root.GetAdjective]s see through these lies... and we can see that this peace, peace on their terms, is a lie as well.'\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] has long derided the weakness of the [From.GetAdjective] nation, but lately the rhetoric has grown more aggressive. The day of armed conflict grows closer."

We must steel ourselves for the struggle to come. For [From.GetName] will not be taken without a fight.'\n\nThe possibility of an understanding between the similarly minded governments of [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] has given way to a campaign to take their territory by force."

By their disdain towards us, and preventing us to seize that which is rightfully ours, they have made us one of those threats to themselves. Their weak and divided nation will hardly resist our claims.'\n\nThe derisive opinion of [From.GetName] long held by the [Root.GetRulingParty] has developed from criticism to hostility. Although popular opinion is that the [From.GetAdjective] people want to avoid war, [Root.GetLeader] claims that their elected leaders have provoked it through their arrogance."

While [From.GetLeader]'s successes are the result of a recent fad, a destructive mass movement bent on bullying other nations into submission, the [Root.GetRulingParty] stands in opposition to that movement as the ones who will not submit. I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate this threat, even if it means war.'\n\nThe [Root.GetLeader] regime has adopted a hostile policy towards the [From.GetAdjective] nation.

For too long, the [From.GetAdjective] have possessed the means that we need to make it through the trials we may face, and it's apparent that they will not part with them peacefully. Despite our best efforts to build a modern state, some matters can only be settled through the old trials of battle.'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s hostile rhetoric towards [From.GetName] has gone to great lengths to justify an invasion. Some portion of the population support this course, but the decision lies in the lands of our leader."
